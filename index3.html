         <h2>Why you should play football</h2>
         <p>Here are the top 5 reasons why everyone must play football atlest once in their life.</p>
     </div>
     <div class="div2 cd">This is probably one of the best benefits of playing Football. The average player runs about 8 to 11 kilometers in a full game. The constant walking, jogging and running help keep the playerâ€™s heart rate up, providing an excellent cardiovascular exercise. This constant movement helps players strengthen their hearts, resist plaque build-up in the coronary arteries, reduce their blood pressure and burn excess calories.</div>

     <div class="div4 hd"> Increases Cognitive Brain Function</div>
     <div class="div5 fr cd">Football helps increase skills in concentration, persistence, and self-discipline because it is a fast-paced game that requires quick decisions on the field. Even when the tempo appears to slow down, players are constantly looking for territorial advantages, trying to position themselves to receive a pass or to defend an area the opponent may attack.</div>
     <div class="div6">Football is a great sport for burning fat because it works the muscles and your heart in different ways. Football builds more muscle mass and burns more fat by recruiting both slow-twitch and fast-twitch muscle fibers. As a general workout, football playing burns more calories than typical workouts because players are forced to switch between using the aerobic and anaerobic energy pathways.</div>

     <div class="div8 hd">Increase Confidence and Reduce Anxiety</div>
     <div class="div9 fr cd">Building physical strength and endurance help build confidence in a player both on and off the field. Confidence and self-esteem not only impact sports performance, but also performance in school, career, family life, and friendships. Also, as with all forms of exercise, the feel-good endorphins released into the body after a match are major stress and anxiety reducers. Several studies point to exercise as being a highly effective treatment for depression and anxiety.</div>
     <div class="div10 cd">While fitness goals are generally very personal, we can all benefit from sharing common goals with others who push us towards them. The lessons that players learn on the field translate to the rest of their lives and the camaraderie teammates share in unparalleled. The ability to work with others to reach a common goal is powerful when related to everyday life- in other words, join a team.</div>
